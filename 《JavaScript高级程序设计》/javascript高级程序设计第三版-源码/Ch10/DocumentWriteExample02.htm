<p>Because the string &quot;</script>&quot; is
included
with <
code > document.write() < /code>,
the
script
tag
is
closed
before
reaching
its
natural
end.That
means
you
'll see some extra
text
here:<
/p>
< script
type = "text/javascript" >
    document.write("<script type=\"text\javascript\" src=\"file.js\">" +
        "</script>");
    </script>
    <
    /body>
    < /html>
